# HACKADEMIA
Team name: Team REMY <br>
Team members: Molly Vongsakhamphouy, Emily Bever, Ryan Connolly, Robin Heft <br>
Advisor: Giovani Abuaitah <br>

At Hackademia, our mission is to empower individuals to master the ever-evolving realms of cybersecurity, networking, and operating systems. We believe that knowledge is the key to a secure and connected future, and our online learning platform is dedicated to fostering expertise, creativity, and ethical responsibility in these critical domains.

## Project Description
Cybersecurity exists at the intersection of many different computing fields: programming, operating systems, networking, etc. Complex cybersecurity concepts, like buffer overflows, are more difficult to learn because a wider breadth of knowledge, in all levels of program abstraction, is required. Hackademia is an interactive cybersecurity educational tool used to animate stack-based vulnerabilities and exploits. This bridges the gap from high-level C code to low-level assemblyâ€“ visualizing how a program is run within the CPU, and how attackers can take advantage of its flaws. In a debugging-style platform, students step through each assembly instruction of a program. The stack and registers are updated accordingly, giving direct insight as to what is happening under the hood.
