# HACKADEMIA
Team name: Team REMY <br>
Team members: Molly Vongsakhamphouy, Emily Bever, Ryan Connolly, Robin Heft <br>
Advisor: Giovani Abuaitah <br>

At Hackademia, our mission is to empower individuals to master the ever-evolving realms of cybersecurity, networking, and operating systems. We believe that knowledge is the key to a secure and connected future, and our online learning platform is dedicated to fostering expertise, creativity, and ethical responsibility in these critical domains.

## Project Description
Our senior design project revolves around developing a web-based cybersecurity education platform. This platform seeks to simplify complex networking, systems, and cybersecurity concepts through interactive visuals and comprehensive explanations. It will employ a tech stack that includes JavaScript, React, Node.js, and either Postgres or MongoDB for database creation. The project emphasizes user-friendliness and educational efficacy. To ensure a streamlined approach, we're implementing project management techniques like Scrum and Agile. Through regular goal-setting, consistent feedback, and collaborative teamwork, our aim is to produce a valuable educational tool that bridges gaps in understanding cybersecurity.
