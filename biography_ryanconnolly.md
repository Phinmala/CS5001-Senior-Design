## Type of Project Sought 

- Something with machine learning. Not entirely sure what, but from my limited experience with ML I am very intrigued with it 

- Not an idea in itself, but I would like to my project to have the opportunity to create a GUI for usability, as that’s something I have little experience in but would like to gain some with 

- Fairly open to any project ideas with software development, especially using Python or a more front-end language that I could get some experience in
